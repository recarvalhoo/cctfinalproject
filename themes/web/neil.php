                                    <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 16px;" class="text-uppercase">Neil spent six years with Burke-Kennedy Doyle & Partners, one of Ireland's leading architectural firms, spending time at the helm of major commercial and prestigious projects including the Earlsfort Centre, the reconstruction of Lower Leeson Street and the Square in Tallaght (the largest shopping centre in Europe at the time).
                                            
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 16px;" class="text-uppercase">The motivation to set up his own practice was based upon Neils desire to push the boundaries of architecture, considering landscaping, interiors and environmental aspects at the early stages of his design process. He believes that successful architecture does not end with the building envelope, but that often it is the attention to detailing, manner of delivery and context that merits professional recognition, and ultimately public enjoyment.
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify"class="text-uppercase">This commitment to the 'architecture' means that the focus has never solely been on larger, more prestigious commissions; the smaller niche projects will always be kept as an aspect of the portfolio.
